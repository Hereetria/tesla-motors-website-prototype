<br>

## 📌 Project Overview

It focuses on layout, structure, and responsive design principles without the use of any frameworks or JavaScript.  
> 📌 **Archived** — This project is no longer being updated. It’s kept as part of my **learning history** and also serves as a **reference/template** for future projects I may revisit.
